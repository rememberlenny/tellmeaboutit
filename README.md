# Tell Me Bout It 


Tell me bout it is a web app and call-in number that allows you to listen to and share your breakup stories.

The breakup of a formerly glorious relationship can feel like the greatest tragedy to befall mankind. At least in the universe of those who are experiencing it.

But as we collectively and staggeringly grow out of painful breakups and emerge as changed people, the stories of these tragedies become different kinds of stories. They become dark, hilarious comedies that evoke tears from laughter, not grimaced, snot- drenched faces. They become stories worth bragging about, candidates for the worst breakup story in a circle of friends.
```
"Oh here’s a worse story!"

"Nah-uh, I win this one!"

"Wait til you hear about this breakup."
```
If time heals all wounds, then with enough temporal distance, perhaps a good number of these tragedies become nuggets of emotional wisdom that help us keep our own lives — and those of others — in perspective. They become stories we share like a bottle of wine, on which we feast with a bittersweet understanding of the past as it pertains to our future.

This web app and call-in number is intended to help you share your painful experiences in the hopes of halving the pain for all of us.

The idea for this project came from responses that one of the creators received after working through her divorce through data visualizations on her blog Quantified Breakup.
