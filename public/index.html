		                      			When I was in college and I was dating a girl for a while and I realized it wasn't working out but I did not know how to end it. 
		                      			So, I knew she was going to Ecuador Christmas and study Broad and I kind of broke up with her. I drove her to the airport in like before she got on the plane I just said hey I don't think this is working out and then helped move over the luggage to the curb and I regretted it and she hated me and we don't really talk any more but sometimes, you know,that had to happen.

		                      			So, what this plan. My sophomore year of college. I'd been going out with this 48461 and we both know that we loved each other and everything and it was. Oh weeks before my birthday that we made plans to hang out and I had traveled probably 40 minutes to your neighborhood to go see him and you told me that he didn't wanna hang out because he was gonna go play basketball. Even though we had these plans for a while. So then I told him that we were either going to break up or you can come see me because I spend all that time and he just decided that basketball is more important. So, we end up breaking up.
